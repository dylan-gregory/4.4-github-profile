## 4 4 github profile

This was my first attempt at working with AJAX calls to an API. Thankfully, GitHub has a super awesome and easy to use API, which I queried to bring in all of the data you see here: the photos, list of projects, organizations, etc. This project is what definitely brought programming to a whole new level in my mind - dynamic data is a game changer.
